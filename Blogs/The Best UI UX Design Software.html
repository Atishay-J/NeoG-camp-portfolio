      <h1 class="title">The Best UI/UX Design Software</h1>
      <h4 class="article">
        A key part of the prototyping process is thinking about information
        architecture, user flow diagrams, and getting content together. You’ll
        want to make sure that your UI design tool works seamlessly with the
        tool you’re using to manage this process. Slickplan’s website planning
        app works well with all UX prototyping tools. With that in mind, let’s
        have a look at this year’s top UI and UX prototyping tools.
        <pre>1. Sketch</pre>
        Sketch is one of the most popular tools for designing websites and apps,
        and it does prototyping too. In fact, it’s one of the most used UI
        design tools around. It’s a lightweight tool with a simple interface,
        leaving designers free to focus on the task at hand. Sketch lets you
        transition seamlessly between design screens (artboards), add
        animations, and create working prototypes with a couple of clicks. Plus
        you can easily share prototypes and get instant feedback via Sketch’s
        cloud interface.
        <pre>2. Adobe XD</pre>
        Adobe XD is a feature rich tool that offers everything from wireframing
        to prototyping, and allows you to test your designs, too. Whether you’re
        designing web or mobile apps, or want to try voice interactions, you can
        do it from a single interface. Collaboration is easy, and it integrates
        with other Creative Cloud apps. Plus you can preview your designs on
        mobile via the iOS and Android apps. Price: The starter plan is free for
        1 shared prototype, 1 active design spec and 2GB of cloud storage.
        Upgrade for $9.99 a month for unlimited prototypes and design specs and
        100GB of cloud storage. It’s also included in the more costly Creative
        Cloud all apps subscription.
        <pre>3. Figma</pre>
        Figma is Joanna Ngai’s favorite prototyping tool, though she believes in
        choosing tools according to your needs. This browser-based tool lets you
        design, prototype, and collaborate in the same space. It’s easy to scale
        designs, combine layers, use Boolean operations, and use vectors. You
        can also handle scrolling, interactions, device frames, and overlays
        with ease. And you can create shared team libraries of resources and
        components for even quicker prototyping. Collaboration is built in with
        workflows, collaborative editing, copy editing, and quick feedback via
        shared links.
        <pre>4. Framer X</pre>
        If you’re looking for a high fidelity macOS prototyping tool, Framer X
        is worth a look. It gives you access to an extensive component library,
        so you can design your UI with a couple of clicks. You can use an
        infinite canvas to prototype user flows, and it’s easy to handle
        scrolling and navigation, and design popup and slide-in elements. Framer
        also includes motion effects.
