      <h1 class="title">What's the difference in - Var, Let, and Const</h1>
      <h4 class="article">
        One of the features that came with ES6 is the addition of let and const,
        which can be used for variable declaration. The question is, what makes
        them different from good ol' var which we've been using? If you are
        still not clear about this, then this article is for you. In this
        article, we'll discuss var, let and const with respect to their scope,
        use, and hoisting. As you read, take note of the differences between
        them that I'll point out.
        <pre>
          Var
        </pre>
        Before the advent of ES6, var declarations ruled. There are issues
        associated with variables declared with var, though. That is why it was
        necessary for new ways to declare variables to emerge. First, let's get
        to understand var more before we discuss those issues.
        <pre>Scope of var</pre>
        cope essentially means where these variables are available for use. var
        declarations are globally scoped or function/locally scoped. The scope
        is global when a var variable is declared outside a function. This means
        that any variable that is declared with var outside a function block is
        available for use in the whole window. var is function scoped when it is
        declared within a function. This means that it is available and can be
        accessed only within that function.
        <pre>Let</pre>
        let is now preferred for variable declaration. It's no surprise as it
        comes as an improvement to var declarations. It also solves the problem
        with var that we just covered. Let's consider why this is so.
        <pre>let is block scoped</pre>
        A block is a chunk of code bounded by {}. A block lives in curly braces.
        Anything within curly braces is a block.
        <pre>Const</pre>
        Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. const
        declarations share some similarities with let declarations.
        <pre>const declarations are block scoped</pre>
        Like let declarations, const declarations can only be accessed within
        the block they were declared.Like let declarations, const declarations
        can only be accessed within the block they were declared.
