        The Flexible Box Layout Module, 
        makes it easier to design flexible 
        responsive layout structure without 
        using float or positioning.
    </br>
    Since flexbox is a whole module and not a 
    single property, it involves a lot of things 
    including its whole
     set of properties. Some of them are meant 
     to be set on the container (parent element, 
     known as “flex container”) whereas the others
      are meant to be set on the children (said “flex items”).
</br>
    If “regular” layout 
    is based on both block and inline flow directions, 
    the flex layout is based on “flex-flow directions”. 
    Please have a look at this figure from the specification, 
    explaining the main idea behind the flex layout.

</br>
When working with flexbox you need to think in terms 
of two axes — the main axis and the cross axis. The main
 axis is defined by the flex-direction property, and the 
 cross axis runs perpendicular to it. Everything we do 
 with flexbox refers back to these axes, so it is worth 
 understanding how they work from the outset.
</br>

The main axis
The main axis is defined by flex-direction, which has four possible values:
<pre>
row
row-reverse
column
column-reverse
</pre>


Should you choose row or row-reverse, your main axis will run along the row in the inline direction.
</br>
The flex container
An area of a document laid out using flexbox is called a flex container. 
To create a flex container, we set the value of the area's container's display 
property to flex or inline-flex. As soon as we do this the direct children of that 
container become flex items. As with all properties in CSS, some initial values are
 defined, so when creating a flex container all of the contained flex items will behave 
 in the following way.
<pre>
Items display in a row (the flex-direction property's default is row).
The items start from the start edge of the main axis.
The items do not stretch on the main dimension, but can shrink.
The items will stretch to fill the size of the cross axis.
The flex-basis property is set to auto.
The flex-wrap property is set to nowrap.
</pre>
The result of this is that your items will all line up in a row, using the size of the content as their size in the main axis. If there are more items than can fit in the container, they will not wrap but will instead overflow. If some items are taller than others, all items will stretch along the cross axis to fill its full size.
